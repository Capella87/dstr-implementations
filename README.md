# Dstr-Implementations : A Collection of Data Structure Implementations

## Announcements

After my consideration, I decided to change this repository name to algorithms. I will integrate algo-implementations to this repository soon by using branch merge. The main reason is that maintaining unified repository will much be easier. Also, this repository contains sorting algorithms, so I think it is better to change the name to algorithms and integrate.

Fortunately, the smart GitHub Copilot suggested lots of algorithms and data structures that I've learned or implemented yet. I am strongly considering to implement those... Thank you GitHub Copilot!

## What's This?

It has data structure and some sorting implementations in several languages. Currently I wrote in several languages.
