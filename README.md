# Dstr-Implementations : A Collection of Data Structure Implementations

## What's This?
It has data structure and some sorting implementations in several languages. Currently I wrote in C, C++, C# and Python. More languages such as Java, Go and more in future.

* Heap (Array based; Max and min heap)
* Singly Linked List
* Stack (Linked List based)
* Queue (Linked List based)

### Graph
